# ACK is also very powerful

it basically does whatever I want for my xxx

    sudo apt-get install ack-grep
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/bin/ack

then in vim

    :Ack xxx

or maybe have this in .vimrc

    map ,k :Ack <cword><ENTER>

# BUG:
 
  xxx "word word" 

does suport string with space in, the bug was fixed.

## ncurses

you can get ncurses api doc by moving your cursor on it and K (open man page) in vim

## Regexp

    .     matches any character
    .*    matches any set of characters

[0-9a-f][0-9a-f] : two hex bit

	peter@bull:~$ grep [0-9a-f][0-9a-f] test 
	12
	aa
	1a
	peter@bull:~$ cat test 
	12
	1
	aa
	1a

	peter@bull:~$ 

find a word, case ignored

	peter@bull:~$ grep -i  '\<hello\>'  dd
	hello
	hello my love
	Hello

## how to install search.vim

find . -exec grep "$1" '{}' \; -print|vim -s /usr/share/vim/vim72/syntax/search.vim -

# echo "text for vim" |vim -
# read from stdout
# find . -exec grep peter {} \; -printf "FILENAME:\n" -print|vim -
# the above "-printf" may help with navigation in vim
# and now I have this to avoid the items in .git/
#
#    find . |grep -v .git| xargs grep -in tig
#
#

## dev note

If you've configured your ncurses with --enable-sigwinch, then you can go the 
easy way out, and just watch the characters that you get from getch() for a 
KEY_RESIZE. When ncurses handles the SIGWINCH signal, it pushes a KEY_RESIZE 
back onto the queue that getch() uses, so that the next call to getch() will 
return that value. However, not everyone's ncurses library has been configured 
with that switch, so relying on that behavior is not portable.

## ncurses & Unicode

The normal ncurses libraries support 8-bit characters. The ncurses library can
also be configured (--enable-widec) to support wide-characters (for instance
Unicode and the UTF-8 encoding). The corresponding wide-character ncursesw
libraries are source-compatible with the normal applications. That is,
applications must be compiled and linked against the ncursesw library.

The ncurses 5.3 release provides UTF-8 support. The special cases of Linux
console and screen were addressed in development patches completed at the end
of 2002.

for Chinese support, you need to install the `w` version of lib ncurse

    sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev

MAC:

    since I do not know how to install dev headers for ncurses on mac, so I stupidly copied the 

        ncurses.h

    from a linux machine, and then use

        gcc -I.

    it sucks.

### exclude multiple directories from find command

    find . -type d \( -name dir -o -name dir1 -o -name dir2 \) -prune -o -print
